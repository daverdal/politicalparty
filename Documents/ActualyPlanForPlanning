Actual Plan for Strategic Planning Module (Visible Phases)

Goal
- Make Strategic Planning feel simple and inviting for players while giving AMC leadership enough structure to run real planning cycles.

Core Concepts
- One Strategic Plan (StrategicSession) per location per year (already implemented).
- Everyone collaborates on Issues, Goals, Actions, Comments; identities are mostly hidden.
- Plans move through a small number of visible phases that feel like “status”, not a rigid process.

Visible Phases (player-facing)
- Start (system status: draft)
  - Label: “Getting started”
  - Behavior: full editing, no required fields, friendly copy, no warnings.
- Check (system status: discussion)
  - Label: “Quick check”
  - Behavior: soft validation only, plan visible to leadership, comments encouraged, no scoring.
- Do (system status: decision)
  - Label: “Working on it”
  - Behavior: focus on actions and goal progress; players can check off actions; optional quick check-ins (👍 😐 👎).
- Wrap (system status: completed)
  - Label: “Wrapped up”
  - Behavior: lock main edits (title/vision/issues/goals/actions); allow reflections and notes; easy “Copy for next time”.

Mapping to Existing Backend Status
- Backend PLAN_STAGES = ['draft', 'discussion', 'decision', 'review', 'completed'].
- Player-facing phase mapping:
  - draft      → Phase: Start – “Getting started”
  - discussion → Phase: Check – “Quick check”
  - decision   → Phase: Do – “Working on it”
  - review     → Phase: Do (still “Working on it”, focused on refinement)
  - completed  → Phase: Wrap – “Wrapped up”

Data Model (StrategicSession node)
- Existing fields we rely on:
  - status: one of PLAN_STAGES, drives internal lifecycle and notifications.
  - createdAt, updatedAt, stageStartedAt, cycleStart, cycleEnd.
  - issuesJson, commentsJson, goalsJson, actionsJson, swotJson, pestJson, reviewJson.
- Additional derived fields (no schema change required):
  - phaseKey: derived from status using the mapping above (Start / Check / Do / Wrap).
  - phaseLabel: derived friendly label (“Getting started”, “Quick check”, etc.).
  - phaseSince: use stageStartedAt or createdAt for “Phase since” text in the UI.

Frontend: Planning Page (planning-page.js)
- Header
  - Show current phase along with status:
    - Example: “For Manitoba Policy Nerds • Phase: Start – Getting started • Status: draft”.
  - Tooltip or small help text under the header describing what this phase means.
- Timeline
  - Keep using cycleStart / cycleEnd for the main line.
  - Optionally tint background or add a small legend: “Current phase: Do – Working on it”.
- Actions by Phase (light-touch UX only at first)
  - Start: show suggestion text like “Add issues or goals; nothing is final yet.”
  - Check: encourage comments and quick reactions, but no harsh validation.
  - Do: highlight actions list; maybe emphasize due dates and completion checkboxes later.
  - Wrap: show a small “Reflection” comment area and label that main structure is wrapped.

Permissions and Transitions
- Who can change phase?
  - Start simple: only admins (already true because status updates go through admin-only route).
  - Later: allow plan creators or designated “location moderators” to request/status change.
- How phases change:
  - No “Next Phase” wizard buttons.
  - Use existing status changes on the backend (PUT /api/strategic-sessions/:id with status), surfaced as:
    - A small dropdown or link for admins: “Plan phase / status”.
    - Auto-advance logic (already present) can keep moving statuses over time; UI just reflects it.

Safety and Tone Rules
- Do not show anything that feels like scoring or “grading” ridings.
- Avoid showing how “late” a plan is; show where we are instead (“Phase: Do – Working on it”).
- Keep copy short, friendly, and optimistic.

Implementation Plan (first slice)
- Backend
  - Reuse existing PLAN_STAGES and status field; no schema change.
  - Optionally add a helper (or just embed mapping logic in the frontend) to map status → phaseKey / phaseLabel.
- Frontend (planning-page.js)
  - Step 1: Derive phaseKey and phaseLabel from activeSession.status.
  - Step 2: Update the plan header to display: location, phase, and status.
  - Step 3: Add a short line of helper text under the header based on phaseKey.
  - Step 4 (optional): Add a small legend near the timeline showing the current phase.

Future Enhancements (later)
- Add a very small admin-only control to adjust status/phase from the UI (uses existing PUT route).
- Add optional quick check-ins (👍 😐 👎) during Do phase and show aggregated mood.
- Add “Copy for next time” action in Wrap phase to clone a completed plan into a new year’s plan.
