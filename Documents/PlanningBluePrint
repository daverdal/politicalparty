Cursor Blueprint (Updated with Phases)

You can paste this over the previous blueprint or replace it.

🔹 CURSOR PROJECT PROMPT — PLANNING WITH PHASES 🔹

Build a simple planning module with hidden phases.
Users should never feel like they’re in a “process”, but the system should stay organized.

Planning Phases (Internal Only)
Phase	System Status	Staff Language
Start	draft	“Getting started”
Check	active	“Quick check”
Do	active	“Working on it”
Wrap	done	“Wrapped up”
Staff-Facing Questions (DO NOT CHANGE)

What are we focusing on for the next 3 months?

What are we actually going to do?

Who’s involved or can help?

Phase Behaviors
Start (draft)

Full editing

No required fields

Friendly tone

No warnings

Check (active)

Soft validation only

Visibility to leadership

No rejection or scoring

Comments allowed

Do (active)

Check off actions

Optional check-ins (👍 😐 👎)

UX Rules

Phases should feel like natural moments, not steps

No “Next Phase” buttons

Phase changes should feel automatic or optional

Explicit Rule

If a feature makes staff feel judged, rushed, or managed — remove it.

Why This Is the Right Balance

Leadership gets structure

Staff get simplicity

Ridings feel respected

Planning becomes a habit, not a burden

Next really useful step

If you want, we can:

Rename phases into cultural language (Circle / Fire / Path / Rest)

Decide who can move a plan between phases

Design the leadership overview screen that stays non-threatening

You’re asking the right questions — this is exactly how good systems get built.
